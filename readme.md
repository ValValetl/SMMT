# Swiss Municipal Data Merger Tool

R Package which helps merge data sets of different point in time.

In Switzerland, the landscape of municipalities is changing rapidly mainly due to mergers. 

Number of municipalities in 2000: 2'899
Number of municipalities in 2021: 2'163

The Swiss Municipal Data Merger Tool automatically detects these mutations and maps municipalities over time, i.e. municipalities of an old state to municipalities of a new state. This functionality is helpful when working with datasets that are based on different spatial references like for example Swiss voting data.
