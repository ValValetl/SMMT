# SMMT

In Switzerland, the landscape of municipalities is changing rapidly mainly due to mergers. The Swiss Municipal Data Merger Tool automatically detects these mutations and maps municipalities over time, i.e. municipalities of an old state to municipalities of a new state. This functionality is helpful when working with datasets that are based on different spatial references. The spatial reference in this context signifies a set of municipalities at a given point in time.
