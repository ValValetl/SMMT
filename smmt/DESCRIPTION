Description: In Switzerland, the landscape of municipalities is changing rapidly
  mainly due to mergers. The Swiss Municipal Data Merger Tool 
  automatically detects these mutations and maps municipalities over time, i.e. municipalities of an old state
  to municipalities of a new state. This functionality is helpful when working 
  with datasets that are based on different spatial references. The package's idea is discussed in the following article: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/spsr.12487.
  reference in this context signifies a set of municipalities at a given point in time.
